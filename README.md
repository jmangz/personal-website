# My Personal Website
Just an idea I had for creating my personal website which simply provides some information and links about myself.

## Built with
It's built with React, Webpack, and Babel. I wanted something a little more dynamic.

## Hosting
Currently I have it up and running with Github Pages. You can find it [here](https://jmangz.github.io/personal-website/).

## Work in Progress
It's a work in progress, so feel free to suggest improvements or report bugs.
